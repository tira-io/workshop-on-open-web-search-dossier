# Submissions of dossier

This repository contains TBD.

## Developing in Github Codespaces

- Open this repository in Github Codespaces (i.e., click on "Code" -> "Codespaces" -> "Create ...").
- Please do not forget to commit often


## Developing in Dev Containers

A dev container (please find a suitable installation instruction [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)) allows you to directly work in the prepared Docker container so that you do not have to install the dependencies (which can sometimes be a bit tricky).

To develop with dev containers, please:

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your machine
- Clone this repository: `git clone ...`
- Open the directory `jupyter-notebook-submissions` with VS Code (it should ask you to open the repository in a dev container)
